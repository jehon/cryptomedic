      Dear sir,<br />
      <br />
      Your are currently using a browser who is too old. For information, the
      following browsers are deprecated not supported:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Firefox older than version 67 (please ensure your firefox is maximum
          one year old)
        </li>
        <li>
          Chrome older than version 63 (please ensure your firefox is maximum
          one year old)
        </li>
        <li>Internet Explorer is not supported</li>
        <li>Microsoft Edge is not supported</li>
        <li>Safari is not supported</li>
      </ul>
      These browser are out of date, and the technologies used are now obsolete.
      Supporting those browsers is too complicated, and would require too much
      work. So I ask you to use a "modern" browser.<br />

      <br />
      You are invited to install one of those browsers:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Chrome [recommended]:
          <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/"
            >here in english</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Firefox:
          <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en/firefox/new/">here in english</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Microsoft Edge: if you really want to, but I do not recommand this one
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
