TODO Migration 3.0.0

flash:
- AppController.php
- PatientsController.php
- UsersController.php

If you want to continue using SHA1 hashing used in 2.x use ’passwordHasher’ => ’Weak’ in your authenticator configuration

The method login() has been removed and replaced by setUser() instead. To login a user you now have to call identify() which returns user info upon successful identification and then use setUser() to save the info to session for persistence across requests.


Folders:
- Layouts is now Layout
- Elements is now Element
- Scaffolds is now Scaffold
- Errors is now Error
- Emails is now Email (same for Email inside Layout)

View Class:
• View::getVar() has been removed, use Cake\View\View::get() instead.
• View::$ext has been removed and instead a protected property View::$_ext has been added.
• The base, webroot, here, data, action, and params magic properties have been removed. You should access all of these properties on $this->request instead.


New ORM Upgrade Guide:
- lots to be done here !!!
