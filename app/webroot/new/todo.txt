After migration:
- SchoolClass ou pas? (consult-introduction)
- examiner name = a list:  Rezaul, Ershad, Murshed, Ricta, Shetou, Dr Taslim, Dr Monir, Dr AMD-KDM
- migrate L/R to L+R in Club Foot file
- Drop table orthopedic_devices
- Drop table surgeries_followups

Done:
v- add patient
v- ctrl_file: if it is a patient, no page is set, but in edit, that leads us to /1234//edit (strange notation). Impact in ctrl_home:createReference
v- validate the forms -> howto ? see below an idea
v- factorize the management of lastuser into dbtable
v- business rules to be migrated
v- day of consult
v- put models into application.models
v- display validations errors on pages

Pending:
- manage pictures
- test validation on IE
- export in xls
- patient reporting (complete xls file for a patient)

Later:
- put files list on menu bar collapsed ? check in "gsm" mode (page index.php?)
- manage timestamps on partials
- move application images, css, partials... out of angular into app\
- on delete: message box to confirm action
- global reportings
- change password
- enforce rules server-side: patient_id not modified (created ok), lastuser, modified, created, id = non modifiable (black list?), ...
- take out specific menu out of angular -> app\
- create domains + filter by referer path? (see headers sent by server)
