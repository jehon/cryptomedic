After migration:
- SchoolClass ou pas? (consult-introduction)
- examiner name = a list:  Rezaul, Ershad, Murshed, Ricta, Shetou, Dr Taslim, Dr Monir, Dr AMD-KDM
- migrate L/R to L+R in Club Foot file
- Drop table orthopedic_devices
- Drop table surgeries_followups

Write mode:
v- locked/unlock
v- save modified file
v- add file
v- delete file
v- perish the cache after some times
- change price according to date in bills (model) + watch in controller
- add patient
- validate the forms -> howto ? see below an idea + business rules to be migrated

var $myForm = $('#myForm')
if (!$myForm[0].checkValidity()) {
  // If the form is invalid, submit it. The form won't actually submit;
  // this will just cause the browser to display the native HTML5 error messages.
  $myForm.submit()
}
$myForm.find(':submit').click()

Later:
- put files list on menu bar collapsed ? check in "gsm" mode (page index.php?)
- change password
- put models into application.models
- move application images, css, partials... out of angular into app\
- take out specific menu out of angular -> app\
- enforce rules server-side: patient_id not modified (created ok), lastuser, modified, created, id = non modifiable (black list?), ...
- on delete: message box to confirm action
