Done:

- limit patient delete if there are subfiles
- e2e testing
- test validation on IE (cfr e2e)

- put files list on menu bar collapsed ? check in "gsm" mode (page index.php?)
- manage timestamps on partials
- when connecting to a page unauthenticated, should reload everything after login (hint: on fail, relaunch instead of throw error???)
- move application images, css, partials... out of angular into app\
- global reportings
- change password
- enforce rules server-side: patient_id not modified (created ok), lastuser, modified, created, id = non modifiable (black list?), ...
- take out specific menu out of angular -> app\
- create domains + filter by referer path? (see headers sent by server) 
- change salt, cipher and db password
